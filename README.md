# GuildBridgeClient
A 1.8.9 Forge mod that links Hypixel Guild chat with a Discord channel client-side.

## NOTICE
This mod is specifically made for IronLegion, a Hypixel Skyblock Ironman Guild. If you're not a member of the guild, this mod probably isn't going to help you.

This mod is specifically made to work with a Discord bot and a web API I'm privately hosting, and the source code for them will not be shared here.

If you need help creating a similar mod, you can contact me using the info below, and I'll be happy to try to help.
 
## Installation
1. Install [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html). This mod is not compatible with other clients, and I'm not knowledgable enough to change that.
2. Download the mod from the [releases](https://github.com/anastarawneh/GuildBridgeClient/releases) page and place it in your `.minecraft/mods` folder. (If you can't find it, you can create it manually.)
3. Launch the game.
4. Edit the mod config in `Mods` in the title screen or `Mod Options...` in your pause menu, and add the URLs that will be shared in the Guild Discord.
5. Join Hypixel (mc.hypixel.net). If you successfully join, the mod will now connect to the chat bridge server.

## Having problems?
If using the command `/wsreconnect` doesn't help, or the mod isn't working in either direction, or if you have any suggestions or feedback, you can ping me in the Guild Discord (Anas#4896).
